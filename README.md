Review of Analysis:

There was possibly some inaccuracy within the analysis line graph, as theres a sudden drop to median house prices in 2023. This largely doesn't follow the trend of the other values as the graph is ongoingly increasing. This means further review needs to take place to recognise external factors or inaccurate data input.
